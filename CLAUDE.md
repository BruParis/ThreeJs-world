# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Three.js + TypeScript boilerplate project that implements a tectonic plate simulation using halfedge data structures. 
The project has evolved from a basic Three.js boilerplate into a specialized visualization tool for spherical tessellation and plate tectonics modeling.
As the project develops, algorithms, data structures, and similar components should be progressively encapsulated into self-contained, reusable modules.

## Build and Development Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts webpack-dev-server on http://127.0.0.1:8080 with hot module reloading. The dev server serves from `dist/client/`.

The dev will be manually setting up the server, the agent should not attempt to automate this process.

### Production Build
No Production build for now

### Production Server
No production server for now

## Architecture

### Client/Server Split

- **Client** (`src/client/`): Three.js visualization running in the browser, compiled via webpack
- **Server** (`src/server/`): Minimal Express server for production deployment, compiled via tsc

The server is only needed for production deployment. Development uses webpack-dev-server.

### Application Structure

The client code is organized by purpose and domain:

### Halfedge Data Structure

The core of this project is a custom implementation of the halfedge data structure. 
The halfedge structure is located in `src/client/core/`:

- **HalfedgeGraph**: Main container managing vertices, faces, and halfedges
  - Uses `Map<string, Halfedge>` for halfedges (keyed by vertex IDs)
  - Uses `Map<number, Vertex>` for vertices
  - Uses `Set<Face>` for faces
  - Changed from Arrays to Maps for performance optimization

- **Halfedge**: Edge representation with dual direction (twin)
  - Each edge has `next`, `prev`, `twin` pointers
  - Contains `vertex` (origin vertex) and optional `face`
  - Provides `nextLoop()` and `prevLoop()` generators for traversing face boundaries
  - ID format: `vertex.id-twin.vertex.id`

- **Vertex**: Stores position (THREE.Vector3) and reference to one outgoing halfedge

- **Face**: Represents a polygon via a reference to one of its boundary halfedges

- **Operations** (`src/client/core/operations/`): Topological operations on the graph
  - `addVertex`, `addEdge`, `addFace`
  - `removeVertex`, `removeEdge`, `removeFace`
  - `splitEdge`: Splits an edge by inserting a new vertex
  - `flipEdge`: Flips edge shared by two triangular faces

### Tectonic Plate System

The project implements a spherical tectonic plate simulation:

- **Dual Graph Pattern**: The icosahedron (primal graph) is subdivided and its dual graph is computed
  - Primal: triangular mesh created by subdividing an icosahedron
  - Dual: polygonal mesh where each vertex corresponds to a primal face
  - The dual graph vertices are normalized to lie on a sphere

- **Tile and Plate Hierarchy** (`tectonics/data/Plate.ts`):
  - **Tile**: Individual polygon in the dual graph, represents a region
    - Has a centroid and motion speed vector
    - Belongs to exactly one Plate
    - Provides `loop()` generator to iterate over boundary halfedges

  - **Plate**: Collection of adjacent tiles forming a tectonic plate
    - Maintains `borderEdge2TileMap` for boundary tracking
    - Has category (CONTINENTAL, OCEANIC, MICROPLATE, DEFORMATION)
    - Computes centroid and rotation (angular velocity)

  - **TectonicSystem**: Global manager for all plates
    - Maps edges to tiles (`edge2TileMap`)
    - Maps edges to boundaries (`edge2BoundaryMap`)
    - Manages plate boundaries and their characterization (convergent, divergent, transform)

- **Key Algorithms**:
  - **tectonics/simulation/Tectonics.ts**: High-level orchestration
    - `buildTectonicSystem`: Initializes random plate distribution via region growing
    - `computeTectonicMotion`: Wrapper that calls dynamics computation
    - `computePlateBoundaries`: Identifies edges between different plates
    - `caracterizePlateBoundaries`: Classifies boundaries by relative motion

  - **tectonics/data/PlateOperations.ts**: Structural operations
    - `floodFill`: Region growing algorithm for plate distribution
    - `splitPlateFromTile`: Splits a plate into two separate plates
    - `transferTileToPlate`: Moves a tile from one plate to another
    - `plateAbsorbedByPlate`: Merges one plate into another

  - **tectonics/dynamics/dynamics.ts**: Motion computation
    - `computeTectonicDynamics`: Assigns random rotation axes to plates, computes tile motion vectors
    - `caracterizeBoundaryEdge`: Classifies boundary edges by relative motion (convergent, divergent, transform)

### Path Aliasing

Both webpack and TypeScript use `@core/*` alias:
- Points to `src/client/core/*`
- Defined in `tsconfig.json` (paths) and `webpack.dev.js` (resolve.alias)
- Use `import { Halfedge } from '@core/Halfedge'` instead of relative paths

### Visualization Stack

- **Three.js**: 3D rendering (r0.168.0)
- **dat.GUI**: Runtime controls for subdivision degree, visibility toggles, plate rebuild
- **OrbitControls**: Camera manipulation
- **CSS2DRenderer**: Label overlays
- **LineSegments2/LineMaterial**: Wide lines for plate boundaries and motion vectors
- **Raycasting**: Face selection via mouse clicks

The main scene contains:
- Icosahedron mesh (primal graph) - usually hidden
- Dual mesh (polygonal tiles) - color-coded by plate
- Various LineSegments2 for visualizing graph edges, plate boundaries, tile boundaries, and motion vectors

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes to Halfedge Operations

When modifying the halfedge structure or operations, note:
- The structure maintains topological invariants (every halfedge has a twin, prev/next form loops)
- Operations in `core/operations/` are the only safe way to modify the structure
- Always update both directions when adding/removing halfedges
- The `id` property on Halfedge is computed, not stored

### Modifying the Tectonic Simulation

The tectonic simulation is managed by `TectonicManager` (`managers/TectonicManager.ts`):
- The GUI includes a "Rebuild Plates" button which calls `TectonicManager.rebuildTectonicPlates()`
- The subdivision degree can be changed (0-7) which triggers a full rebuild via `VisualizationManager.rebuildIcosahedron()`
- Plate coloring is handled by `TectonicManager.colorTectonicSystem()`

Key interaction modes (handled by `InteractionHandler`):
- Click on dual mesh to select a tile/plate
- Selection displays: tile edges (thick lines), plate edges (thicker lines), boundaries (thickest)
- Available operations: `splitPlateAtEdge`, `transferTileAtEdge`, `absorbPlateFromEdge` (implemented in TectonicManager)

### TypeScript Configuration

- **Client** (`src/client/tsconfig.json`):
  - Target: ES6
  - moduleResolution: bundler (for webpack)
  - Strict mode enabled

- **Server** (`src/server/tsconfig.json`):
  - Target: ES2019
  - Module: commonjs
  - Output: `dist/server/`
  - esModuleInterop enabled for Express compatibility

## Common Patterns

### Iterating Over Face Boundaries
```typescript
for (const he of face.halfedge.nextLoop()) {
  // he is a halfedge on the face boundary
  const vertex = he.vertex;
  const nextVertex = he.next.vertex;
}
```

### Finding Opposite Face
```typescript
const oppositeFace = halfedge.twin.face;
```

### Adding Geometry to Scene
Always preserve rotation when rebuilding meshes:
```typescript
let rotation: THREE.Euler | null = null;
if (existingMesh) {
  rotation = existingMesh.rotation.clone();
  scene.remove(existingMesh);
}
// ... create new mesh ...
if (rotation) {
  newMesh.rotation.copy(rotation);
}
scene.add(newMesh);
```

### Color Assignment
Use `assignColorToTriangle()` to set vertex colors for an entire triangle. The dual mesh uses vertex colors extensively for plate visualization.

### Doc
The doc/ folder is not real software documentation. Just some draft, notes on ideas. Do not read them unless beign specifically prompted to do so.

## Branch Structure

This repository has multiple feature branches (stats, statsgui, socketio, cannonjs, etc.) demonstrating different Three.js capabilities. The master branch is the minimal baseline without these features.
